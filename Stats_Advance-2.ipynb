    "The normal distribution has the remarkable property stated in the so-called central limit theorem. According to this theorem as the sample size n increase, the distribution or mean, X of a random sample taken from practically any population approaches a normal distribution. Thus, if samples of large size, n, are drawn from a population that is not normally distributed, nevertheless the successive sample means will form themselves distribution that is approximately normal. As the size of the sample is increased the sample means will tend to be normally distributed. The central limit theorem applies to the distribution of most other statistics as well, such as the median and standard deviation (but nor range). The central limit theorem gives the normal distribution its central place in the theory of sampling since many important problems can be solved by this single patter of sampling variability. As a result the work on statistical inferences is made simpler.\n",
