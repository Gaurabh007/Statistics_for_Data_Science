If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",

Let D represent the event that a person has the disease, and let T represent the event that a person tests positive for the disease. Then, we want to calculate P(D|T), the probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive.\n",

Note that D' represents the complement of D, or the event that a person does not have the disease.\n",
